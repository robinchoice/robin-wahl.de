## About Me

I’ve been in Bitcoin since 2020 and active in the industry since 2024.  
With a background in Business Intelligence at SAP, I’ve helped organizations translate data into strategy.  
Realizing that Bitcoin is the most strategic asset any company can adopt, I joined the Bitcoin ecosystem in Zug — contributing to both the holding and the DAO behind a sustainable mining initiative.
