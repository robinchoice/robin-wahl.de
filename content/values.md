# Core Values

- **Sovereignty**  
  I believe in individual freedom â€“ economically, digitally, and spiritually.

- **Open Source**  
  Sharing knowledge, tools, and processes is key to sustainable progress.

- **Long-Term Thinking**  
  I design and build systems with future generations in mind.

- **Interconnectedness**  
  The best ideas arise at the intersection of disciplines, cultures, and people.

- **Integrity**  
  Do the right thing, even when no one is watching.
